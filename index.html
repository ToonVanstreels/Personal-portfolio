            I am a passionate motorsport engineer with hands-on experience in race engineering. I currently work full-time for RedAnt Racing in the Porsche Carrera Cup Benelux and 24H Series.
            In the future, I aim to join a larger motorsport organization. I thrive in well-organized, driven teams focused on achieving the best possible results.

             <h2>RedAnt Racing Team</h2>
             <h3>Full-time, Oct. 2023 - present</h3>
             <p>During the winter break before the 2023 season, I joined the RedAnt Racing Team. We compete in the <span class="highlight">Porsche Carrera Cup Benelux and the 24H Series</span> championships.
                As a full-time engineer, I manage all runtime tracking, plan revisions, order parts and supplies, create damage reports, loading lists and plans, and design pit box layouts.
                For the 2024 season, I served as the race engineer for the #69 car in the Carrera Cup Benelux, driven by <span class="highlight">Kalle Rovanperä</span>. My responsibilities included preparing pre- and post-event reports, defining setup changes and run plans, and conducting data and video analysis.
                In the 2025 season, I continue to work as a race engineer in the Carrera Cup Benelux.
                We work with a fleet of <span class="highlight">6 Porsche 992 Cup cars</span>, using PI Toolset and Bosch RaceCon for car communication and PI Toolbox for data analysis. The cars are equipped with a Racelogic VBOX video system and a LiveU Solo for live video streaming.
                In addition to this work, I developed the projects presented below.

             <h3>Internship, Mar. 2021 - Sept. 2021</h3>
             <p>
              This internship was part of the Le Mans Erasmus program called "Développement des Véhicules de Compétition."
              During this 16-week internship, I worked full-time for Belgium Racing Team, based in Lommel, Belgium. We competed in the <span class="highlight">Porsche Carrera Cup Benelux and Belcar series</span> with the then brand-new Porsche 992 Cup car. 
              The goal of this internship was to gain insight into how a race team operates both in the workshop and at the track.
              My role was to work as a mechanic and to complete a project that formed part of my internship evaluation. Together with a fellow intern, we <span class="highlight">developed an LTE telemetry system</span> for the 991 generation of the Porsche Cup car. 
              Although we did not manage to finish the system, I gained valuable knowledge and experience from the project.
              In addition to the project, I was responsible for tasks such as servicing cars, loading trucks, workshop cleanliness, and much more.</p>

             <p>
              As a student worker, I worked for Labor Aiding Systems Europe, a company that designs and builds manufacturing machines for automotive manufacturers.
              My job was to <span class="highlight">post-process parts after they were machined on a CNC mill or lathe</span>. This involved drilling, tapping, and finishing parts according to technical drawings. 
              I was responsible for ensuring that all parts were ready for installation in the assembly area, with no sharp edges or imperfections.

          <p>The Event Clock is a live schedule tool that allows users to easily see how much time remains until an event starts and how much time is left in an ongoing event.
            Team members can access the Event Clock on their devices through any web browser.
            This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is publicly available via GitHub Pages.

            This project creates a <span class="highlight">post race analysis</span>, using the csv timing results files. The csv files first run trough a Python script to put the data in a uniform order. 
            This way data of different timing providers can be used to create an analysis. A second Pyhton script applies many calculations to the data and creates an <span class="highlight">HTML report</span> as a final result.
            A user can open the report in a browser and is able to <span class="highlight">zoom, hoover and scroll in the report</span>. The above example shows an analysis of the 2025 FIA WEC 6h of Imola Hypercar race.

          <h2>Brake Simulator</h2>
          <p>
            Because the feel of a brake pedal in a race car can differ from that of a race simulator, this simulator plots real-time CAN-bus data of the car’s brake pressure over an ideal brake pressure trace.
            This allows drivers to train their braking technique in the same car they will drive on track. An Arduino is used to interpret the CAN messages, while a Python script generates and plots the brake traces.
            It is also possible to overlay an onboard video for additional reference.

             <h3>KU Leuven, 2021-2022</h3>
             <p>
              To qualify for a master’s degree, I was required to complete a transition program. During this year, all essential subjects for a master’s degree in electromechanical engineering were covered.
              Topics included mathematics, mechanics, physics, chemistry, strength of materials, and databases. In the second part of the year, we focused on <span class="highlight">3D CAD modeling and advanced FEM analysis and simulation</span>. The software used for this was <span class="highlight">Creo</span>.
              As a project, I <span class="highlight">designed a gearbox for a conveyor belt</span>. The layout and gears were first calculated, then modeled in Creo. FEM simulations were performed on all critical parts to iterate and improve the design.
              Although I was not able to complete the program, I gained valuable knowledge and skills that I continue to use today.

             <h3>Développement des véhicules de compétition</h3>
             <h3>Le Mans University, 2020-2021</h3>
             <p>
              For my final bachelor year, I took part in an Erasmus program at the University of Le Mans. This 12-month motorsport-focused course consisted of six months of classes and a six-month internship.
              Many of the lectures were <span class="highlight">taught by professional race engineers</span>, while the practical sessions took place at the DAMS team facility in Le Mans. The theoretical lectures focused on working within a race team — covering the different roles, car setup processes, and key principles of <span class="highlight">vehicle dynamics, kinematics, and data analysis</span>.
              During the sessions at DAMS, I gained valuable insight into how the team operates. We also <span class="highlight">performed a full setup of a Formula E car</span> in their workshop, where we learned how to measure and adjust parameters such as camber, caster, toe, and ride height.
              Although strict COVID-19 measures and curfews made the social aspect of my Erasmus experience less enjoyable, I still appreciated living and studying in Le Mans for six months.

             <h3>Thomas More, 2018-2020</h3>
             <p>
              This program covered all aspects of how a car works, starting from the basic principles of mechanics, electricity, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, strength of materials, engines, gearboxes, and more.
              In the latter part of the program, the focus shifted to <span class="highlight">diagnosing faults in electrical and bus systems</span> using tools such as an oscilloscope, as well as learning how to tune engines.
              The course also briefly covered alternative fuels and hybrid systems.

              Education focused on the design process of mechanical parts, beginning with working in 3D CAD software and progressing to <span class="highlight">creating technical drawings according to ISO standards</span>.
              During practical seminars, I learned to operate conventional lathes and mills to produce highly accurate parts. In later years, I also gained experience <span class="highlight">working with CNC lathes and mills</span>.
